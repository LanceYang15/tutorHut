# tutorHut
Place where tutors gather! Tutors are able to create a profile, list a subject they wish to tutor in, and accept/decline tutor requests. Users are able to search for tutors, view their profiles, and send tutor requests. Added feature of listing nearby schools with an input location using Google's map, geolocation and nearby places functionality.

## Responsibility
